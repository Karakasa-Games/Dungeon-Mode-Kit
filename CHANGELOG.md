# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Pie in the sky

- falling between levels instead of instadeath
- tile flipbook animations
- music engine
- Continuity: start at any specified prototype as whatever that protos controllable actor is, OR enter from stairway as the previous player character, with inventory etc
- Alternative first-person view pane (for perspective dungeon style play)
- Extend the text discription area to optionally plug into parallel text environments for a paired room in Evennia or inform7 etc for text adventure or mud stuff?

### Planned

- put a counter by repeated description messages rather than let them add additional messages to list

### In Progress

- Mining (works but requires testing and refinement, Currently 3 hits always removes a breakable actor, which feels unnatural)
- FOV epistemology (currently messages aren't filtered by vision range, make sound alternate messages for those, also some things like mining walls can still be seen out of range)
- Ball of thread item and entity trails (this is almost done, last tile of thread is hidden when walking down but still overlaps actor top tile when approaching from under on either side)

## [0.8a] 2025-01-26

### Added

- Trap system (Brogue-style):
  - Traps start invisible and become visible when triggered
  - Re-triggerable: same trap can fire multiple times when stepped on again
  - Won't re-trigger while same actor/item remains on tile
  - Items on traps "hold down" the trigger, preventing re-triggering until removed
  - Hazard warning prompts before stepping on visible traps (skipped if item holds trigger)
  - Can be triggered by thrown items landing on them
  - Two trap effect formats:
    - `trap_spawn`: spawns single actor (e.g., poison cloud)
    - `trap_effect`: spell-like area effect with center/radius/outer (e.g., fire trap)
  - `trap_apply_state`: applies a state to actors caught in the trap's effect
  - Trap types:
    - `poison_gas_trap`: spawns spreading poison cloud that damages health
    - `fire_trap`: spawns intense_fire at center with fire in radius 1 (like fireball)
    - `paralysis_gas_trap`: spawns spreading gas that paralyzes actors
    - `confusion_gas_trap`: spawns spreading gas that confuses actors
- State-applying potions:
  - Potions can now apply states via `use_effect: { "apply_state": "state_name" }`
  - `potion_of_poison`: applies poisoned state (damage over time)
  - `potion_of_confusion`: applies confused state (random movement)
  - `potion_of_haste`: applies hasted state (extra turn)
  - `potion_of_paralysis`: applies paralyzed state (skip turns)
  - `potion_of_regeneration`: applies regenerating state (heal over time)
  - Thrown explosive potions create clouds that apply their state to actors
- `paralyzed` state: actors skip turns for 6 turns (similar to stunned but longer)
- Actor `data` property: actors now store their full definition data for behavior access
- Per-turn stat modifications (data-driven):
  - Stats can have `per_turn` value for automatic changes each turn (e.g., nutrition drain, health regen)
  - `fatal: true` makes stat depletion kill the actor (health is always fatal)
  - `death_message` for custom death text when stat reaches zero
  - `warnings` array for threshold-based messages (e.g., hunger warnings at 50%, 25%, 10%)
  - Equipment `wear_effect` can modify per-turn rates (e.g., `"nutrition_per_turn": 0.5` reduces hunger)
  - Passive inventory effects can also modify per-turn rates
- Combat turn costs:
  - Item use takes one turn
  - Multi-turn armor equipping based on strength requirement
    - Armor with `requires_stat: { strength: X }` takes X turns to equip and can't be equipped without the minimum strength stat
    - Progress shown in actor list as "(equipping.)" with dots for turns spent
    - Equipping can be cancelled by starting to equip a different item
- Knockback weapon proc now staggers target (target loses next turn)
- Item action menus now close before effects execute for better visual feedback
- Item stats system with per-turn modification (for recharging items like staffs):
  - Items can now have `stats` with `per_turn`, `ready_at`, and `ready_message`
  - Item stats process each turn when item is in actor's inventory
  - `start` value allows items to begin uncharged (e.g., `"start": 0`)
- Targeted spell system for items:
  - `use_effect: "targeted_spell"` enables aiming mode with mouse targeting
  - `charge_stat` and `charge_cost` for items that need to recharge between uses
  - `spell_range` limits how far spells can be cast
  - `spell_effect` spawns actors at target: `{ center, radius, outer }`
  - `projectile_tile` and `projectile_tint` customize the spell projectile appearance
  - Spell aiming shows orange path (gray if out of range)
- Staff of Fireball item:
  - Casts fireball that spawns intense_fire at center and fire in radius 1
  - Recharges 5% per turn, requires 100% charge to cast
  - Shows "Your Staff of Fireball is fully charged!" when ready
  - Starts unidentified with random substance name (e.g., "malachite staff")
- Substances data loaded globally for `[substances.substances]` template syntax
- Item identification now supports `[substances.substances]` template variable

### Fixed

- Click-to-walk path now restores properly after exiting spell aiming or throw aiming modes
- Staff `uses` attribute now works correctly: a staff with `uses: 2` costs half pow per use and shows proper charge count
- Staff thermometer now displays total power as fraction of max, giving clear visual feedback when charges are used
- Gas clouds now properly apply states (paralysis, confusion) to actors:
  - Added `sentient` attribute to creature actors (player, skeleton, etc.) to mark which actors can be affected by states
  - Clouds apply state when spreading to a tile with an actor (not just when actor walks in)
  - Actors check for cloud effects when moving into a tile
- Combat message ordering: attack descriptions now appear before death messages
- Fixed double death messages when multiple enemies attack simultaneously
- Fixed dead actors being attacked (early exit check in applyCollisionEffects)
- Fixed AI attacking twice per turn: missed attacks now properly consume the turn
  - `applyCollisionEffects` now returns `attackAttempted` flag (true even on miss)
  - `attack_adjacent` and `defend_self` behaviors return true on any attack attempt
  - `tryMove` uses `attackAttempted` instead of `effectApplied` for action taken
- Fixed multiple actors spawning when set to 100% max 1 in prototype:
  - `spawnUnplacedEntities` now skips actors configured in `random_actors`
  - `removeEntity` now also removes actor from scheduler
- Fixed doors being attacked instead of opened: openable check now happens before combat
- Fixed stairways being hidden by walls: wall spawning skips tiles with stairways
- Canvas stat thermometers now normalized to fixed width (10 tiles) regardless of max value
- HTML stat ratio numbers hidden for stats with max > 100 (thermometer-only display)
- Canvas stat thermometers hidden when HTML `#actors` element exists (avoids duplication)

### Changed

- Death is now triggered after attack messages are shown, not during stat modification
- Updated COMBAT.md with turn costs, knockback stagger, and multi-turn equipping documentation

## [0.7b] 2025-01-22

### Added

- Optional HTML sidebar for actors and items:
  - `#actors` div displays visible actors with stats
  - `#items` div displays visible items with "Visible Items" header
  - `#description` existing area for action messages and hover inspection messages which clear.
  - Actors with stats are listed in actors, not doors walls lava etc.
  - Stats with current/max ratios displayed as thermometer bars (1/1 stats hidden)
  - Inventory attribute shown as current/max ratio numbers not thermometer
  - Sidebar updates automatically on visibility changes (needs testing), entity add/remove, and actor death
  - Sidebar elements optional - embedded prototypes work without them, could start simply and then add complexity over each level

### Fixed

- Equipment sprites no longer duplicated when actors have default_items equipped
- light_source actors no longer cast a shadow entity

## [0.7a] 2025-01-20

### Added

  - Templated attack messages with `[actor_name]`, `[attacked_actor_name]`, `[weapon_name]`, `[attacks.melee_verbs]`
  - Miss messages when attacks fail hit roll
- Procedural dungeon generation:
  - PRISON_WINDOW (tile 16) and OPAQUE_PRISON_WINDOW (tile 152) wildcards for rooms + corridors (ROT.Map.Digger)
  - Existing maze wildcard (tile 210) uses ROT.Map.EllerMaze
  - Automatic up_stairway placement if none manually placed in generated levels
  - Locked up_stairway spawns if prototype has no previous_level
  - Fixed fully procedural maps (no map.tmj) to use correct tile format
- Random actor spawning via prototype config:
  - `random_actors` object in prototype.json
  - Per-actor `chance` (0-100%), `min`, and `max` spawn counts
  - 100% chance = exactly one guaranteed spawn
- Deep water current system:
  - Actors and items float and drift with configurable current direction
  - Items update sprite position when floating

- Fog of war memory: "You remember seeing [entity]" for explored but not visible tiles
- Message stacking: multiple events in same turn display together (e.g., attack + death)
- Item identification system:
  - Items can have `random_color: true` for randomized appearance per prototype
  - Unidentified/identified name templates (e.g., "blue potion" → "Potion of Healing")
